# formik
This form is a signup page that users can fill out with their email and password. Users will be alerted of what they need to include if they leave out any fields.

## How to Run?
Once you put in information the form will provide you with feedback.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements
It's currently difficult for users to tell if they were able to fill out the form properly. An alert in red and success with green woudl be helpful.

## License Information
This project was created as part of the MIT xPRO Full Stack Development program. Formik, babel, and react were used.
